css pseudo-elements

? previous
next ?


what are pseudo-elements?
a css pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
for example, it can be used to:

style the first letter, or line, of an element
insert content before, or after, the content of an element 


syntax
the syntax of pseudo-elements:


selector::pseudo-element {  property: value;}



the ::first-line pseudo-element
the ::first-line pseudo-element is used to add a special style 
to the first line of a text.
the following example formats the first line of the text in all <p> 
elements:


example 

p::first-line 
{
   
color: #ff0000;
   
font-variant: small-caps;
}
try it yourself »


note: the ::first-line pseudo-element can only be applied to block-level 
elements.
the following properties apply to the ::first-line 
pseudo-element:

  font properties
  color properties
  background properties
  word-spacing
  letter-spacing
  text-decoration
  vertical-align
  text-transform
  line-height
  clear



notice the double colon notation -  ::first-line versus
:first-linethe double colon replaced the single-colon 
notation for pseudo-elements in css3. this was an attempt from w3c to 
distinguish between pseudo-classes 
and pseudo-elements.the single-colon syntax was used 
for both pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in css2 and css1.for 
backward compatibility, the single-colon syntax is acceptable for css2 and css1 
pseudo-elements.






  
  



the ::first-letter pseudo-element
the ::first-letter pseudo-element is used to add a special style to the first 
letter of a text.
the following example formats the first letter of the text in all <p> 
elements: 

example

p::first-letter 
{
   
color: #ff0000;
   
font-size: xx-large;
}
try it yourself »


note: the ::first-letter pseudo-element can only be applied to block-level 
elements.
the following properties apply to the ::first-letter pseudo- element: 

   font properties
   color properties 
   background properties
  margin properties
  padding properties
  border properties
  text-decoration
  vertical-align (only if "float" is "none")
  text-transform
  line-height
  float
  clear



pseudo-elements and html classes
pseudo-elements can be combined with html classes: 

example

p.intro::first-letter {  color: #ff0000;  
font-size: 200%;} 
try it yourself »

the example above will display the first letter of paragraphs with class="intro", in 
red and in a larger size.


multiple pseudo-elements
several pseudo-elements can also be combined.
in the following example, the first letter of a paragraph will be red, in 
an xx-large font size. the rest of the first line will be blue, and in 
small-caps. the rest of the paragraph will be the default font size and color:


example

p::first-letter
{
  color: #ff0000;
  font-size: xx-large;
}
p::first-line 
{
   
color: #0000ff;
   
font-variant: small-caps;
}
try it yourself »



css - the ::before pseudo-element
the ::before pseudo-element can be used to insert some content before the content of an element.
the following example inserts an image before the content of each <h1> element:

example

h1::before 
{
  content: url(smiley.gif);
}
try it yourself »



css - the ::after pseudo-element
the ::after pseudo-element can be used to insert some content after the content of an element.
the following example inserts an image after the content of each <h1> element:

example

h1::after
{
  content: url(smiley.gif);
}
try it yourself »



css - the ::marker pseudo-element
the ::marker pseudo-element selects the 
markers of list items.
the following example styles the markers of list items:

example

::marker { 
  color: red;  font-size: 23px;
}
try it yourself »



css - the ::selection pseudo-element
the ::selection pseudo-element matches the portion of an element that is 
selected by a user.
the following css properties can be applied to ::selection: 
color, 
background, cursor, and outline.
the following example makes the selected text red on a yellow background:

example

::selection {  color: red;   
background: yellow;}
try it yourself »




test yourself with exercises

exercise:
set the background-color to red, of the first line of the paragraph.

<style>
 {
  background-color: red;
}
</style>

<body>

<p class="intro">
in my younger and more vulnerable years
my father gave me some advice that i've
been turning over in my mind ever since.
'whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me,
'just remember that all the people in this world
haven't had the advantages that you've had.'
</p>
