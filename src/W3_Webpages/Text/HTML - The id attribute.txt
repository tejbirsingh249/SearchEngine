html id attribute

? previous
next ?


the html id attribute is used 
to specify a unique id for an html element.
you cannot have more than one element with the same id in an 
html document.


using the id attribute
the id attribute specifies a unique id 
for an html element. the value of the id 
attribute must be unique within the html document.
the id attribute is used to point 
to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. it is also used by javascript to access and 
manipulate the element with the specific id.
the syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. 
then, define the css properties within curly braces {}.
in the following example we have an <h1> element that points to the 
id name 
"myheader". this <h1> 
element will be styled according to the #myheader 
style definition in the head section:


example

  <!doctype html><html><head><style>#myheader {  
  background-color: lightblue;  color: black;  padding: 40px;  
  text-align: center;} </style></head><body><h1 id="myheader">my 
  header</h1></body></html>

 try it yourself »




  note: the id name is case sensitive!
  note: the id name must contain at least one 
  character, cannot start with a number, and must not contain whitespaces (spaces, tabs, 
  etc.).



difference between class and id
a 
class name can be used by multiple html elements, while an id name must only be 
used by one html element 
within the page:

example

  <style>/* style the element with the id "myheader" 
  */
  #myheader {  background-color: lightblue;  
  color: black;  padding: 
  40px;  text-align: center;}/* style all 
  elements with the class name "city" */.city
  {  background-color: tomato;  color: white;  padding: 10px;} </style>
  <!-- an element with a unique id --><h1 id="myheader">my 
  cities</h1><!-- multiple elements with same class --><h2 class="city">london</h2><p>london is the capital of england.</p>
  <h2 class="city">paris</h2><p>paris is the capital of france.</p>
  <h2 class="city">tokyo</h2><p>tokyo is the capital of japan.</p>

  tip: you can learn much more about css in our css tutorial.






  
  



html bookmarks with id and links
html bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a webpage.
bookmarks can be useful if your page is very long.
to use a bookmark, you must first create it, and then add a link 
to it.
then, when the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the 
bookmark.
example
first, create a bookmark with the id attribute:


<h2 id="c4">chapter 4</h2>

then, add a link to the bookmark ("jump to chapter 4"), from within the same page:

example

 <a href="#c4">jump to chapter 4</a>

try it yourself »

or, add a link to the bookmark ("jump to chapter 4"), from another page:


<a href="html_demo.html#c4">jump to chapter 4</a>




using the id attribute in javascript
the id attribute can also be used by javascript to perform 
some tasks for that specific element.
javascript can access an element with a specific id with the getelementbyid() method:


example
  use the id attribute to manipulate text with javascript:

  <script>function displayresult() {  document.getelementbyid("myheader").innerhtml = "have a nice day!";}
  </script>

 try it yourself »


tip: study javascript in the html javascript chapter, or in our
javascript tutorial.
