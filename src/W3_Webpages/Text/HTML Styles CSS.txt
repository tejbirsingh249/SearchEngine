html styles - css

? previous
next ?


css stands for cascading style sheets.
css saves a lot of work. it can control the layout of multiple 
web pages all at once.



  
  
  
 css = styles and colors
 manipulate text
 colors,
  boxes
 




what is css?
cascading style sheets (css) is used to format the layout of a webpage.
with css, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing 
between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background 
images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices 
and screen sizes, and much more!


tip: the word cascading means that a style 
applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the 
parent. so, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, 
paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify 
something else)!



using css
css can be added to html documents in 3 ways:

  inline - by using the style attribute inside html elements
  internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
  external - by using a <link> 
  element to link to an external css file

the most common way to add css, is to keep the styles in external css 
files. however, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to 
demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.


inline css
an inline css is used to apply a unique style to a single html element.
an inline css uses the style attribute of an html element.
the following example sets the text color of the <h1> element to blue, 
and the text color of the <p> element to red:

example

 <h1 style="color:blue;">a blue heading</h1><p 
  style="color:red;">a red paragraph.</p>
try it yourself »






  
  


internal css
an internal css is used to define a style for a single html page.
an internal css is defined in the <head> section of an html page, 
within a <style> element.
the following example sets the text color of all the <h1> elements 
(on that page) to blue, and the text color of all the <p> elements to 
red. in addition, the page will be displayed with a "powderblue" background 
color: 

example

<!doctype html><html><head><style>
 body {background-color: powderblue;}h1   {color: blue;}p    {color: red;}
</style></head><body><h1>this is a 
 heading</h1><p>this is a paragraph.</p></body></html>
try it yourself »



external css
an external style sheet is used to define the style for many html pages.
to use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each html page:

example

<!doctype html><html><head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head><body><h1>this is a heading</h1><p>this is a paragraph.</p></body></html>
try it yourself »

the external style sheet can be written in any text editor. the file must not contain any 
html code, and must be saved with a .css extension.
here is what the "styles.css" file looks like:

"styles.css":

 body {  background-color: powderblue;}h1 {  color: blue;}p {  color: red;}


tip: with an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire web site, by changing one file!



css colors, fonts and sizes
here, we will demonstrate some commonly used css properties. you will learn 
more about them later.
the css color property defines the text color to be used.
the css font-family property defines the font to be used.
the css font-size property defines the text size to be used.

example
  use of css color, font-family and font-size properties:

<!doctype html>
 <html><head><style>h1 {  color: blue;  font-family: verdana;  font-size: 300%;}p {
    color: red;  
 font-family: courier;  font-size: 160%;}</style></head><body>
 <h1>this is a heading</h1><p>this is a paragraph.</p></body></html>
try it yourself »



css border
the css border property defines a border 
around an html element.
tip: you can define a border for nearly all html elements.

example
  use of css border property: 

 p {  border: 2px 
solid powderblue;}

try it yourself »



css padding
the css padding property defines a padding 
(space) between the text and the border.

example
  use of css border and padding properties:

 p {  border: 2px 
solid powderblue;  padding: 30px;}
try it yourself »



css margin
the css margin property defines a margin 
(space) outside the border.

example
  use of css border and margin properties:

 p {  border: 2px 
solid powderblue;  margin: 50px;
 }
try it yourself »



link to external css
external style sheets can be referenced with a full url or with a path relative to the current web page.


example
  this example uses a full url to link to a style sheet:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/styles.css">


try it yourself »



example

this example links to a style sheet located in the html folder on the current web site: 

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/html/styles.css">


try it yourself »



example
  this example links to a style sheet located in the same folder as the current page:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">


try it yourself »



you can read more about file paths in the chapter html 
file paths.



chapter summary

  use the html style attribute for inline styling
  use the html <style> element to define internal css
  use the html <link> element to refer to an external css file
  use the html <head> element to store <style> and <link> elements
  use the css color property for text colors
  use the css font-family property for text fonts
  use the css font-size property for text sizes
  use the css border property for borders
  use the css padding property for space inside the border
  use the css margin property for space outside the border


  tip: you can learn much more about css in our css tutorial.
