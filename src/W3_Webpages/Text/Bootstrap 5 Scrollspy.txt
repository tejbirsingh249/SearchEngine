scrollspy
scrollspy is used to automatically update links in a navigation 
list based on scroll position.




how to create a scrollspy
the following example shows how to create a scrollspy:

 example

 <!-- the scrollable area --><body data-bs-spy="scroll" data-bs-target=".navbar" data-bs-offset="50"><!-- the navbar - the <a> elements are used to jump to a section in the scrollable area --><nav 
  class="navbar navbar-expand-sm bg-dark navbar-dark fixed-top">...  <ul class="navbar-nav">    <li><a href="#section1">section 1</a></li>    ...</nav><!-- section 1 --><div id="section1">  <h1>section 1</h1>  <p>try to scroll this page and look at the navigation bar while scrolling!</p></div>...
 </body>
try it yourself »


example explained

add data-bs-spy="scroll" to the element that should be used as the scrollable 
area (often this is the <body> element).
then add the data-bs-target attribute with a value of the id or the class name 
of the navigation bar (.navbar). this is to make sure that the navbar 
is connected with the scrollable area.
note that scrollable elements must match the id of the links inside the navbar's 
list items 
(<div id="section1"> matches <a href="#section1">).
the optional data-bs-offset attribute specifies the number of pixels to offset 
from top when calculating the position of scroll. this is useful when you feel 
that the links inside the navbar changes the active state too soon or too early 
when jumping to the scrollable elements. default is 10 pixels.

  requires relative positioning: the element with 
data-bs-spy="scroll" 
requires the css position property, with a value of "relative" 
to work properly.
