python conditions and if statements
python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

equals: a == b
not equals: a != b
less than: a < b
less than or equal to: a <= b
greater than: a > b
greater than or equal to: a >= b

these conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

an "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.


example
if statement:

a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:  print("b is greater than a")

try it yourself »

in this example we use two variables, a and b,
which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a.
as a is 33, and b is 200,
we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".

indentation

python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.


example
if statement, without indentation (will raise an error):

a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
print("b is greater than a")
# you will get an error

try it yourself »








  
  


elif
the elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then 
try this condition".


example

a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
	 
	print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
	 
	print("a and b are equal")

try it yourself »


in this example a is equal to b, so the first condition is not true, but the elif condition is true, so we print to screen that "a and b are equal".

else
the else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.


example

a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
	 
	print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
	 
	print("a and b are equal")
  else:
	 
	print("a is greater than b")

try it yourself »


in this example a is greater than b,
so the first condition is not true, also the elif condition is not true,
so we go to the else condition and print to screen that "a is greater than b".

you can also have an else without the
elif:


example

a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
	 
	print("b is greater than a")
  else:
	 
	print("b is not greater than a")

try it yourself »


short hand if

if you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.


example
one line if statement:

  if a > b: print("a is greater than b")

try it yourself »




short hand if ... else

if you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it 
all on the same line:


example
one line if else statement:

  a = 2b = 330print("a") if a > b else print("b")
try it yourself »



  this technique is known as ternary operators, or conditional 
  expressions.



you can also have multiple else statements on the same line:


example
one line if else statement, with 3 conditions:

  a = 330b = 330print("a") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("b")
try it yourself »




and
the and keyword is a logical operator, and 
is used to combine conditional statements:


example
  test if a is greater than
  b, and if c 
  is greater than a:

  a = 200b = 33c = 500if a > b and c > a:
	 
	print("both conditions are true")

try it yourself »




or
the or keyword is a logical operator, and 
is used to combine conditional statements:


example
  test if a is greater than
  b, or if a 
  is greater than c:

  a = 200b = 33c = 500if a > b or a > c:
	 
	print("at least one of the conditions is true")

try it yourself »



nested if
you can have if statements inside 
if statements, this is called nested
if statements.


example

  x = 41if x > 10:
	 
	print("above ten,")  if x > 20:    print("and 
  also above 20!")  else:    print("but not 
  above 20.")
try it yourself »



the pass statement
if statements cannot be empty, but if you 
for some reason have an if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.


example

  a = 33b = 200if b > a:  pass
try it yourself »



test yourself with exercises

exercise:
print "hello world" if a is greater than b.

a = 50
b = 10
 a  b
  print("hello world")



submit answer »
start the exercise
