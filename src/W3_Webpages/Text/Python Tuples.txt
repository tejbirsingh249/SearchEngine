python tuples

mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")



tuple

tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in python used to store collections of 
data, the other 3 are list, 
set, and dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

a tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

tuples are written with round brackets.


example
create a tuple:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)

try it yourself »



tuple items

tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.

tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.



ordered

when we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.



unchangeable

tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.



allow duplicates
since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:

example
tuples allow duplicate values:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
print(thistuple)

try it yourself »







  
  



tuple length

to determine how many items a tuple has, use the 
len() function:


example
print the number of items in the tuple:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(len(thistuple))

try it yourself »




create tuple with one item

to create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, 
otherwise python will not recognize it as a tuple.

example
one item tuple, remember the comma:

thistuple = ("apple",)
  print(type(thistuple))#not a tuplethistuple = ("apple")
  print(type(thistuple))
try it yourself »




tuple items - data types

tuple items can be of any data type:


example
string, int and boolean data types:

tuple1 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
tuple2 = (1, 5, 7, 9, 3)
tuple3 = (true, false, false)

try it yourself »


a tuple can contain different data types:


example
a tuple with strings, integers and boolean values:

tuple1 = ("abc", 34, true, 40, "male")

try it yourself »



type()

from python's perspective, tuples are defined as objects with the data type 'tuple':


<class 'tuple'>



example
what is the data type of a tuple?

mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(type(mytuple))

try it yourself »



the tuple() constructor
it is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple.


example
using the tuple() method to make a tuple:

thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thistuple)

try it yourself »



python collections (arrays)
there are four collection data types in the python programming language:

list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. allows duplicate members.
tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. allows duplicate members.
set is a collection which is unordered, 
unchangeable*, and unindexed. no duplicate members.
dictionary is a collection which is ordered** 
and changeable. no duplicate members.



  *set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items 
  whenever you like.
  **as of python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. 
  in python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.


when choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type. choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.
