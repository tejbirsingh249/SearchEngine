python lists

mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]




list
lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
lists are one of 4 built-in data types in python used to store collections of 
data, the other 3 are tuple, 
set, and dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
lists are created using square brackets:


example
create a list:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

try it yourself »




list items
list items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
list items are indexed, the first item has index [0],
the second item has index [1] etc.

ordered

when we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

if you add new items to a list,
the new items will be placed at the end of the list.


  note: there are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.




changeable

the list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.



allow duplicates

since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:


example
lists allow duplicate values:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

try it yourself »







  
  



list length

to determine how many items a list has, use the 
len() function:


example
print the number of items in the list:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist))

try it yourself »




list items - data types

list items can be of any data type:


example
string, int and boolean data types:

list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
list3 = [true, false, false]

try it yourself »


a list can contain different data types:


example
a list with strings, integers and boolean values:

list1 = ["abc", 34, true, 40, "male"]

try it yourself »



type()

from python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list':


<class 'list'>



example
what is the data type of a list?

mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(type(mylist))

try it yourself »




the list() constructor

it is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a 
new list.


example
using the list() constructor to make a list:

thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thislist)

try it yourself »



python collections (arrays)
there are four collection data types in the python programming language:

list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. allows duplicate members.
tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. allows duplicate members.
set is a collection which is unordered, 
unchangeable*, and unindexed. no duplicate members.
dictionary is a collection which is ordered** 
and changeable. no duplicate members.



  *set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items 
  whenever you like.
  **as of python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. 
  in python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.


when choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type. choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.
