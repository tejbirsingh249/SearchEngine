java linkedlist

java linkedlist
in the previous chapter, you learned about the arraylist class. the linkedlist class is 
almost identical to the 
arraylist:


example
// import the linkedlist class
import java.util.linkedlist;

public class main {
  public static void main(string[] args) {
    linkedlist<string> cars = new linkedlist<string>();
    cars.add("volvo");
    cars.add("bmw");
    cars.add("ford");
    cars.add("mazda");
    system.out.println(cars);
  }
}


try it yourself »



arraylist vs. linkedlist
the linkedlist class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type,
just like the arraylist.

the linkedlist class has all of the same methods as the arraylist class because
they both implement the list interface. this means that you can add items, change
items, remove items and clear the list in the same way.

however, while the arraylist class and the linkedlist class can be used in the same way,
they are built very differently.

how the arraylist works
the arraylist class has a regular array inside it. when an element is added, it is placed
into the array. if the array is not big enough, a new, larger array is created to replace the
old one and the old one is removed.

how the linkedlist works
the linkedlist stores its items in "containers." the list has a link to the first container
and each container has a link to the next container in the list. to add an element to the list,
the element is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other
containers in the list.


when to use
use an arraylist for storing and accessing data, and linkedlist  to 
manipulate data.



linkedlist methods
for many cases, the arraylist is more efficient as it is common to need access to
random items in the list, but the linkedlist provides several methods to do certain
operations more efficiently:




method
description
try it


addfirst()
adds an item to the beginning of the list.
try it »


addlast()
add an item to the end of the list
try it »



removefirst()
remove an item from the beginning of the list.
try it »



removelast()
remove an item from the end of the list
try it »



getfirst()
get the item at the beginning of the list
try it »



getlast()
get the item at the end of the list
try it »
