react events

? previous
next ?




just like html dom events, react can perform actions based on user events.
react has the same events as html: click, change, mouseover etc.



adding events
react events are written in camelcase syntax:
onclick
instead of onclick.
react event handlers are written inside curly 
braces:
onclick={shoot}  instead of
onclick="shoot()". 


react:
<button onclick={shoot}>take the shot!</button>




html:
<button onclick="shoot()">take the shot!</button>





example:
  put the shoot function inside the
  football component:
function football() {
  const shoot = () => {
    alert("great shot!");
  }

  return (
    <button onclick={shoot}>take the shot!</button>
  );
}

reactdom.render(<football />, document.getelementbyid('root'));

passing arguments

to pass an argument to an event handler, use an arrow function.


  example:
  send "goal!" as a parameter to the shoot 
  function, using arrow 
  function:
function football() {
  const shoot = (a) => {
    alert(a);
  }

  return (
    <button onclick={() => shoot("goal!")}>take the shot!</button>
  );
}

reactdom.render(<football />, document.getelementbyid('root'));


run 
example »




react event object
event handlers have access to the react event that triggered the function.
in our example the event is the "click" event.


example:
  arrow function: sending the event object manually:
function football() {
  const shoot = (a, b) => {
    alert(b.type);
    /*
    'b' represents the react event that triggered the function,
    in this case the 'click' event
    */
  }

  return (
    <button onclick={(event) => shoot("goal!", event)}>take the shot!</button>
  );
}

reactdom.render(<football />, document.getelementbyid('root'));


run 
example »



this will come in handy when we look at form in 
a later chapter.



test yourself with exercises

exercise:
complete this statement to include a click event handler.

<button ={clicked()}>click me!</button>
