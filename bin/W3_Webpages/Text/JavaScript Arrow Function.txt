javascript arrow function

? previous
next ?



arrow functions were introduced in es6.
arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:


let myfunction = (a, b) => a * b;


try it yourself »





before:

hello = function() {  return "hello world!";}

try it yourself »




with arrow function:

hello = () => {  return "hello world!";}

try it yourself »




it gets shorter! if the function has only one statement, and the statement 
returns a value, you can remove the brackets and the
return keyword:


arrow functions return value by default:

hello = () => "hello world!";

try it yourself »



note: this works only if the function has only one 
statement.


if you have parameters, you pass them inside the parentheses:


arrow function with parameters:

hello = (val) => "hello " + val;

try it yourself »



in fact, if you have only one parameter, you can skip the parentheses as well:


arrow function without parentheses:

hello = val => "hello " + val;
this

try it yourself »








  
  



what about this?
the handling of this is also different in arrow functions compared to regular 
functions.
in short, with arrow functions there are no binding of
this.
in regular functions the this keyword represented the object that called the 
function, which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever.
with arrow functions the this keyword always represents the 
object that 
defined the arrow function.
let us take a look at two examples to understand the difference.
both examples call a method twice, first when the page loads, and once again 
when the user clicks a button.
the first example uses a regular function, and the second example uses an 
arrow function.
the result shows that the first example returns two different objects (window and button), 
and the 
second example returns the window object twice, because the window object is the 
"owner" of the function.

example
with a regular function this represents the 
object that calls the function:

  // regular function:hello = function() {  document.getelementbyid("demo").innerhtml 
  += this;}// the window object calls the function:
  window.addeventlistener("load", hello);// a button object calls the 
  function:document.getelementbyid("btn").addeventlistener("click", hello);

try it yourself »




example
with an arrow function this represents the 
owner of the function:

  // arrow function:hello = () => {  document.getelementbyid("demo").innerhtml 
  += this;}// the window object calls the function:
  window.addeventlistener("load", hello);// a button object calls the 
  function:document.getelementbyid("btn").addeventlistener("click", hello);

try it yourself »



remember these differences when you are working with functions. sometimes the 
behavior of regular functions is what you want, if not, use arrow functions.



browser support
the following table defines the first browser versions with full support for 
arrow functions in javascript:
