bootstrap 5 default settings
bootstrap 5 uses a default 
font-size of 1rem (16px by default), and its  
line-height is 1.5.

margin-top: 0 and margin-bottom: 1rem (16px by default).


<h1> - <h6>
bootstrap 5 styles html headings (<h1> to
<h6>)  with a bolder font-weight and 
a responsive font-size.

example

  <p class="h1">h1 bootstrap heading</p><p class="h2">h2 bootstrap 
  heading</p><p class="h3">h3 bootstrap heading</p><p class="h4">h4 
  bootstrap heading</p><p class="h5">h5 bootstrap heading</p><p 
  class="h6">h6 bootstrap heading</p>
