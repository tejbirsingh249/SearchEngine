bootstrap 5 containers

bootstrap 5 containers
you learned from the previous chapter that bootstrap requires a containing 
element to wrap site contents.
containers are used to pad the content inside 
of them, and there are two container classes available:

  the .container class provides a responsive fixed width container
  the .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport



  
    
      .container
    
  
  
    
      .container-fluid
    
  


fixed container
use the .container class to create a responsive, fixed-width container.
note that its width (max-width) will change on different screen sizes:



  
    
    
      
        extra small
        <576px
      
      
        small
        ?576px
      
      
        medium
        ?768px
      
      
        large
        ?992px
      
      
        extra large
        ?1200px
      
      
        xxl
        ?1400px
      
    
  
  
    
      max-width
      100%
      540px
      720px
      960px
      1140px
      1320px
    
  


open the example below and resize the browser window to see that the container width will change at different breakpoints:

example

  <div class="container">  <h1>my first bootstrap page</h1>  <p>this is some text.</p> </div>
try it yourself »



the xxl breakpoint (?1400px) is new in bootstrap 5, while the largest breakpoint in bootstrap 4 is extra large (?1200px).



fluid container
use the .container-fluid class to create a full width container, that will always span the entire width of the screen (width is always 100%):

example

  <div class="container-fluid">  <h1>my first bootstrap page</h1>  <p>this is some text.</p> </div>
try it yourself »





  


container padding
by default, containers have left and right padding, with no top or bottom padding. therefore, we often use spacing utilities, such as extra padding and margins to make them look even better. for example, 
.pt-5 means "add a large top padding":

example

  <div class="container pt-5"></div>
try it yourself »





container border and color
other utilities, such as borders and colors, are also often used together with containers:

example




  <div class="container p-5 my-5 border"></div><div class="container 
  p-5 my-5 bg-dark 
  text-white"></div><div class="container p-5 my-5 bg-primary 
  text-white"></div>
try it yourself »


you will learn much more about colors and border utilities in a later chapter.




responsive containers
you can also use the .container-sm|md|lg|xl classes to determine when the container should be responsive.
the max-width of the container will change on different screen sizes/viewports:



  
    
      class
      
        extra small
        <576px
      
      
        small
        ?576px
      
      
        medium
        ?768px
      
      
        large
        ?992px
      
      
        extra large
        ?1200px
      
      
        xxl
        ?1400px
      
    
  
  
    
      .container-sm
      100%
      540px
      720px
      960px
      1140px
       1320px
   
    
      .container-md
      100%
      100%
      720px
      960px
      1140px
       1320px
   
    
      .container-lg
      100%
      100%
      100%
      960px
      1140px
       1320px
   
    
      .container-xl
      100%
      100%
      100%
      100%
      1140px
      1320px
    
    
      .container-xxl
      100%
      100%
      100%
      100%
      100%
      1320px
    
  



example

  <div class="container-sm">.container-sm</div><div 
  class="container-md">.container-md</div><div 
  class="container-lg">.container-lg</div><div 
  class="container-xl">.container-xl</div><div 
  class="container-xxl">.container-xxl</div>
