javascript const

? previous
next ?



the const keyword was introduced in
es6 (2015).
variables defined with const cannot be redeclared.
variables defined with const cannot be reassigned.
variables defined with const have block scope.


cannot be reassigned
a const variable cannot be reassigned:


example

const pi = 3.141592653589793;
pi = 3.14;      // this will give an error
pi = pi + 10;   // this will also give an error

try it yourself »



must be assigned

javascript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:


correct

const pi = 3.14159265359;



incorrect

const pi;
pi = 3.14159265359;



when to use javascript const?
as a general rule, always declare a variable with const unless you know that
the value will change.
use const when you declare:

a new array
a new object
a new function
a new regexp




constant objects and arrays
the keyword const is a little misleading.
it does not define a constant value. it defines a constant reference to a value.
because of this you can not:

reassign a constant value
reassign a constant array
reassign a constant object


but you can:
change the elements of constant array
change the properties of constant object



constant arrays
you can change the elements of a constant array:

example

// you can create a constant array:
const cars = ["saab", "volvo", "bmw"];
// you can change an element:
cars[0] = "toyota";
// you can add an element:
cars.push("audi");

try it yourself »

but you can not reassign the array:


example

const cars = ["saab", "volvo", "bmw"];

cars = ["toyota", "volvo", "audi"];    // error

try it yourself »



constant objects
you can change the properties of a constant object:

example

// you can create a const object:
const car = {type:"fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
// you can change a property:
car.color = "red";
// you can add a property:
car.owner = "johnson";
try it yourself »


but you can not reassign the object:


example

const car = {type:"fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

car = {type:"volvo", model:"ex60", color:"red"};    // 
  error
try it yourself »



browser support
the const keyword is not supported in internet explorer 10 or earlier.
the following table defines the first browser versions with full support for the const keyword: 


  
    
    
    
    
                    
  
  
    chrome 49
    ie 11 / edge    
    firefox 36
    safari 10
    opera 36
  
  
    mar, 2016
    oct, 2013    
    feb, 2015
    sep, 2016
    mar, 2016
  








  
  



block scope
declaring a variable with const is similar to let 
when it comes to block scope.
the x declared in the block, in this example, is not the same as the x declared outside the block:

example

const x = 10;
// here x is 10

{ 
const x = 2;
// here x is 2}

// here x is 10

try it yourself »

you can learn more about block scope in the chapter javascript scope.

redeclaring
redeclaring a javascript var variable is allowed 
anywhere in a program:


example

var x = 2;     // allowed
var x = 3;     // allowed
  x = 4;         // allowed

redeclaring an existing var or let
variable to const, in the same scope, is not allowed:


example

var x = 2;     // allowed
const x = 2;   // not allowed

{
let x = 2;     // allowed
const x = 2;   // not allowed}

{
const x = 2;   // allowed
const x = 2;   // not allowed
}

  


reassigning an existing const variable, in the same scope, is not allowed:


example

  const x = 2;     // allowed
  x = 2;           // not allowed
  var x = 2;       // not allowed
  let x = 2;       // not allowed
  const x = 2;     // not allowed
  { 
  const x = 2;   // allowed
  x = 2;         
  // not allowed  var x = 2;     
  // not allowed  let x = 2;     
  // not allowed
   
  const x = 2;   // not allowed
}
  


redeclaring a variable with const, in another scope, or in another block, is allowed:


example

  const x = 2;       // allowed{ 
  const x = 3;   // allowed
  }
  
  {
  const x = 4;   // allowed
  }



const hoisting
variables defined with var are hoisted to the top 
and can be initialized at any time.
meaning: you can use the variable before it is declared:

example
  this is ok:

  carname = "volvo";
  var carname;

try it yourself »

if you want to learn more about hoisting, study the chapter javascript hoisting.

variables defined with const are also hoisted to the top,
but not initialized.
meaning: using a const variable before it is declared will result in a 
referenceerror:


example

alert (carname);
const carname = "volvo";
