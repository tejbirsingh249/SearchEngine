python classes and objects

? previous
next ?



python classes/objects
python is an object oriented programming language.
almost everything in python is an object, with its properties and methods.
a class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

create a class
to create a class, use the keyword class:


example
create a class named myclass, with a property named x:

  class myclass:  x = 5
try it yourself »





create object

now we can use the class named myclass to create objects:


example
create an object named p1, and print the value of x:

  p1 = myclass()print(p1.x)
try it yourself »



the __init__() function

the examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are 
not really useful in real life applications.
to understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() 
function.
all classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when 
the class is being initiated.
use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other 
operations that are necessary to do when the object 
is being created:


example
create a class named person, use the __init__() function to assign values 
for name and age:

  class person:  def __init__(self, name, age):    
  self.name = name    self.age = agep1 = person("john", 
  36)
  print(p1.name)print(p1.age)
try it yourself »


  note: the __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.







  
  



object methods

objects can also contain methods. methods in objects are functions that 
belong to the object.
let us create a method in the person class:

  example
insert a function that prints a greeting, and execute it on the p1 object:

  class person:  def __init__(self, name, age):    
  self.name = name    self.age = age  def myfunc(self):    
  print("hello my name is " + self.name)p1 = person("john", 
  36)p1.myfunc()
try it yourself »



  note: the self parameter 
  is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.




the self parameter
the self parameter is a reference to the 
current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.
it does not have to be named self , you can 
call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function 
in the class:


example
use the words mysillyobject and abc instead of self:

  class person:  def __init__(mysillyobject, name, age):    
  mysillyobject.name = name    mysillyobject.age = age  def myfunc(abc):    
  print("hello my name is " + abc.name)p1 = person("john", 
  36)p1.myfunc()
try it yourself »




modify object properties

you can modify properties on objects like this:


example
set the age of p1 to 40:

  p1.age = 40
try it yourself »




delete object properties

you can delete properties on objects by using the 
del keyword:


example
delete the age property from the p1 object:

  del p1.age
try it yourself »




delete objects

you can delete objects by using the del keyword:


example
delete the p1 object:

  del p1
try it yourself »



the pass statement
class definitions cannot be empty, but if 
you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.


example

  class person:  pass
try it yourself »





test yourself with exercises

exercise:
create a class named myclass:

 myclass:
  x = 5



submit answer »
start the exercise
