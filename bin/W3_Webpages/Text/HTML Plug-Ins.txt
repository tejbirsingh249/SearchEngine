html plug-ins

? previous
next ?


plug-ins are computer programs that extend the standard functionality of the browser.


plug-ins
plug-ins were designed to be used for many different purposes:

to run java applets
to run microsoft activex controls
to display flash movies
to display maps
to scan for viruses 
to verify a bank id


warning !
most browsers no longer support java applets and plug-ins.
activex controls are no longer supported in any browsers.
the support for shockwave flash has also been turned off in modern browsers.



the <object> element
the <object> element is supported by all browsers.
the <object> element defines an embedded object within an html document.
it was designed to embed plug-ins (like java applets, pdf readers, and flash players) in web pages,
but can also be used to include html in html:


example

<object width="100%" height="500px" data="snippet.html"></object>

try it yourself »


or images if you like:


example

<object data="audi.jpeg"></object>

try it yourself »







  
  


the <embed> element

the <embed> element is supported in all major browsers.
the <embed> element also defines an embedded object within an html document.
web browsers have supported the <embed> element for a 
long time. however, it has not been a part of the html  
specification before html5.


example

<embed src="audi.jpeg">

try it yourself »




note that the <embed> element does not have a closing tag. it can not 
contain alternative text.


the <embed> element can also be used to include html in html:


example

 <embed width="100%" height="500px" src="snippet.html">

try it yourself »
